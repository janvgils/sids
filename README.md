### Preliminary sources

The idea is, to share history, current state and possible new options in regard to SiDS on this repository, in the meantime the following can be used as some base for getting an idea what SiDS is, and how it can support the question of: "How to store telemetry received by multiple stations, all over the world".

Telemetry submission when using [gr-satellites ](https://gr-satellites.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html?highlight=sids#telemetry-submission).

### Available SIDS enabled servers

The following organisations and universities have SIDS servers available online:

```
SatNOGS   : https://db.satnogs.org/api/telemetry/
TU Berlin : http://fachgebiet.rft.tu-berlin.de/ham/telemetry/send
AMSAT-F   : https://amsat.electrolab.fr/api/V2/SIDS
```
### Frame example send by GetKiss+

Below an example where a GRIZU-263A frame is decoded with the help of an UZ7HO sound-modem.
The sound-modem application intefaces via a kiss session towards GetKiss+ and forwards the frames to the destination sids server.
